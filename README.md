Revolution Watchface for [Android Wear](http://www.android.com/wear/)

Based on the display of the [Freebox Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freebox), which was designed by [Philippe Starck] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Starck).

Inspired by the awesome Pebble [Revolution watchface](http://www.mypebblefaces.com/apps/448/455/) ([source code](https://github.com/DouweM/PebbleRevolution)) envisioned by [Jean-NoÃ«l Mattern (Jnm)](http://jnmattern.free.fr/PebbleRevolution/), who posted it in the ["Watch-face ideas"](http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/comment/3538/#Comment_3538) thread on the Pebble forums.
